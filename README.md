### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science Bachelor's student at the University of Saarland in my third semester.
Currently, i have no projects that are of any significance (at least nothing here on GitHub), but I hope that changes soon!
I specialize in C programming, but enjoy programming in all kinds of languages.
